Structure your presentation by answering the following question:

What process did you follow to build your project? Showcase it. 

I was looking at sample codes for structuring by code.
I have used a few resources for this, example youtube and  stackflow.com and links from canvas for the Calculator.. 
I first tried the traditional way of coding, that is following the functions.
I had problem solving some issues with the formula using eval(),
I change my code  using class and method which is similar to what we have familiar with .
I have used the regular structure in class and constructor do achieve the required functions for the calculator.
This includes checking for double decimal entry and deleting using backspace for incorrect typing. 
I have called in the function for each operation using the syntax Switch while  did found a simpler way using eval(). I'm not able to judge which is more advance way of executing the operation but i wanted to practice using switch to do this task.
